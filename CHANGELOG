## [Unreleased] – January 9, 2026

### Added
- **GitHub OAuth Login – Proof of Concept (POC)**  
  - Added an initial GitHub OAuth login implementation as a **POC**.
  - This feature is **incomplete**, **not production-ready**, and requires further development, testing, and security hardening.
  - Intended only to validate feasibility and integration flow.
- **CI/CD deployment notes** indicating that `npm install` must be run before:
  - Running the application locally.
  - Deploying via any CI/CD pipeline, due to multiple new dependencies.
- **API runtime documentation**:
  - The API server is currently running on **port `3001`**.
  - Future changes will explore removing the need for a separate API port (if feasible) to avoid major CI/CD or infrastructure changes.
- **Branch status documentation**:
  - This branch is currently **not in sync with `main`**.
  - Alignment with `main` will be taken up as a follow-up task.

### Notes
- No UI/UX changes were introduced in this update.
- This entry primarily documents authentication POC work, infrastructure, deployment, and workflow considerations.
