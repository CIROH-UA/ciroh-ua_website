## [Unreleased] – January 9, 2026

### Added
- **GitHub OAuth Login – Proof of Concept (POC)**  
  - Added an initial GitHub OAuth login implementation as a **POC**.
  - This feature is **incomplete**, **not production-ready**, and requires further development, testing, and security hardening.
  - Intended only to validate feasibility and integration flow.
- **CI/CD deployment notes** indicating that `npm install` must be run before:
  - Running the application locally.
  - Deploying via any CI/CD pipeline, due to multiple new dependencies.
- **API runtime documentation**:
  - The API server is currently running on **port `3001`**.
  - Future changes will explore removing the need for a separate API port (if feasible) to avoid major CI/CD or infrastructure changes.
- **Branch status documentation**:
  - This branch is currently **not in sync with `main`**.
  - Alignment with `main` will be taken up as a follow-up task.

### Changed
- **OAuth/API hardening and configurability (dev + production)**
  - `server.js` now sets production-safe cookie defaults (`HttpOnly` token cookie, `Secure` in production, `SameSite=Lax`).
  - GitHub API calls now include required headers (notably `User-Agent`) and return richer error details to help diagnose 403s (scopes/accepted scopes).
  - New environment variables:
    - `FRONTEND_URL` (default `http://localhost:3000`)
    - `GITHUB_REPO` (default `CIROH-UA/ciroh-ua_website`)
    - `GITHUB_OAUTH_SCOPE` (default `public_repo`; use `repo` if the target repo is private)
    - `GITHUB_AUTH_SCHEME` (default `token`; can be set to `Bearer` if needed)
    - `ASSIGN_ISSUE_TO_AUTHOR` (optional) — if `true`, the server will attempt to assign the created issue to the logged-in user.
      - Note: assignment may fail depending on repo permissions; the server will still attempt issue creation.
    - `ALLOW_CLIENT_TOKEN` (DEV ONLY) — if set to `true`, makes the `access_token` cookie readable by JS for local debugging.
      - IMPORTANT: Do not enable `ALLOW_CLIENT_TOKEN` in production.

- **Admin UI refresh + session UX**
  - Admin page (`/admin`) now matches the new Tailwind-based dashboard design and shows the signed-in GitHub user's name and avatar.
  - Added `/api/me` to fetch the signed-in GitHub user profile (used by admin header and site-wide auth UI).
  - Added `/api/logout` to clear auth cookies.
  - Added a site-wide Logout button overlay that appears only when signed in.

### Notes
- No UI/UX changes were introduced in this update.
- This entry primarily documents authentication POC work, infrastructure, deployment, and workflow considerations.
