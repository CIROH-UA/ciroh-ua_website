We're excited to share some recent developments and updates from CIROH's Research CyberInfrastructure team:

### Cloud Infrastructure

- CIROH's Google Cloud Account is now fully operational and managed by our team. You can find more information [here.](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/services/cloudservices/google-cloud/)
- We're in the process of migrating our 2i2c JupyterHub to CIROH's Google Cloud account.
- We've successfully deployed the Google BigQuery API (developed by BYU and Google) for NWM data in our cloud. To access this API, please contact us at ciroh-it-admin@ua.edu. Please refer to [NWM BigQuery API](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/products/data-management/bigqeury-api/) to learn more.
