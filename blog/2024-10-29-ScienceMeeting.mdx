Thank you to everyone who participated in making the 2024 CIROH Science Meeting a resounding success. We look forward to continuing our collaborative research efforts across the consortium.



## CIROH 2024 Science Meeting: Fostering Innovation in Hydrology

 

The third annual CIROH Science Meeting, held at The University of Alabama from October 14-17, 2024, brought together our vibrant community of researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders. This four-day event showcased the remarkable progress in our mission to advance national water prediction capabilities.

 

## Meeting Highlights

- Over 300 participants gathered to share knowledge and forge new collaborations

- Engaging discussions spanning critical topics in hydrology

- Special focus on CIROH's four key research themes:

  - Next Generation Water Prediction

  - Community Modeling

  - Hydroinformatics

  - Social Science in Water Resources

 

## Community Engagement

The meeting featured presentations from our consortium members, research partners, and key stakeholders including NOAA/NWS. The diverse agenda included keynotes, project presentations, roundtable discussions, poster sessions, and HIF tour that fostered meaningful discussions about the future of water prediction.

 

Representatives from our member institutions and various partnering organizations contributed to rich dialogues about advancing the National Water Model and related technologies. The collaborative atmosphere exemplified CIROH's commitment to building a stronger hydroinformatics community.

 

## Key Outcomes

- Strengthened partnerships across the consortium

- Shared progress on ongoing research initiatives

- Identified new opportunities for cross-institutional collaboration

- Advanced discussions on improving national water prediction capabilities

- Enhanced understanding of community needs and priorities

 

## Looking Forward

The success of the 2024 Science Meeting reinforces CIROH's role in shaping the future of water prediction. The connections made and ideas shared during these four days will continue to influence our work throughout the year as we strive to improve water prediction capabilities for the nation.
