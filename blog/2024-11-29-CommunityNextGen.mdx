## 🎉 NGIAB-CloudInfra v1.3.0: A Major Milestone

The release of NGIAB-CloudInfra v1.3.0 marks a significant evolution in our Docker-based solution. This version introduces several groundbreaking improvements:

- Integration with CIROH-UA's forked repositories of `ngen` and `t-route`
- Full compatibility with the latest hydrofabric v2.2
- New sample input data AWI-007
- Enhanced visualization capabilities through the NGIAB Visualizer
- Streamlined CI/CD pipeline with a unified Dockerfile
- TEEHR integration for improved evaluation capabilities

## 📝 New End-to-End Workflow Guide

We're excited to announce a comprehensive new end-to-end workflow video tutorial for NGIAB! This resource walks users through the entire process, making it easier than ever to get started with NextGen modeling. The tutorial is available in our [documentation](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101) and provides step-by-step guidance for both new and experienced users.

## 🔄 Infrastructure Updates

### NGIAB-HPCInfra
The Singularity-based solution for high-performance computing has been updated to maintain parity with the Docker implementation, including:
- Updated repositories alignment
- New sample data compatibility
- Enhanced documentation

### Data Processing Tools
- **NGIAB-data-preprocess v3.1.2**: Major update ensuring seamless compatibility with hydrofabric v2.2
- **ngen-datastream**: Significant improvements with 22 new commits enhancing data handling capabilities

## 🌟 New Features

### Hydrofabric v2.2
The latest hydrofabric data model brings improved spatial representation and data organization. This update enhances the framework's ability to represent complex hydrologic systems accurately.

### Repository Updates
- The NextGen Model Framework now operates from CIROH-UA's main branch
- T-route implementation has been updated to use the specialized datastream branch
- Both updates provide better integration and enhanced functionality within the NGIAB ecosystem

## What's Next?

These November updates represent our ongoing commitment to improving the NextGen framework's accessibility and capabilities. With the new workflow video and documentation in place, we're making it easier than ever for the hydrologic modeling community to leverage these powerful tools.

We encourage users to:
1. Explore the new v1.3.0 release
2. Watch the end-to-end workflow video
3. Test out the updated data preprocess and NGIAB tools
4. Provide feedback on your experience

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance and expand the NextGen In A Box ecosystem!
