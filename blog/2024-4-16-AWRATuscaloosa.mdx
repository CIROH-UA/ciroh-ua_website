CIROH CyberInfrastructure team presented on these topics:
* **Accelerating Community Contribution to the Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework**
* **Creating a community dataset for high-speed national water model data access**
* **Model structure selection for the flood and drought predictions using the NextGen Framework based on the extreme event simulations**

CIROH team member **James Halgren** presented the work on **"Accelerating Community Contribution to the Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework." The presentation focused on building and sharing a continuous research data stream using the NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework with NextGen IN A Box (NGIAB).** This project, a collaboration with Lynker members, showcases the potential for open-source tools and community-driven efforts to advance water resources modeling and research.
