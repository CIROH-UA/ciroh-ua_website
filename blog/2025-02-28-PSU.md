# 🌊 Pennsylvania State University Researchers Leverage CIROH Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Hydrological Modeling 🌍

Pennsylvania State University (PSU) researchers have been leveraging CIROH Cyberinfrastructure to tackle complex hydrological modeling challenges. This post highlights their innovative approach using the [Wukong computing platform](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/services/on-prem/Wukong/) in conjunction with Amazon S3 bucket storage to efficiently process and analyze large-scale environmental datasets. 🚀

## 💻 The Computing and Storage Infrastructure

### **Wukong Computing Platform**
The PSU team has been utilizing Wukong, a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster specifically designed for data-intensive scientific applications, such as the high-resolution physics-informed machine learning for national water modeling (Song et al. 2024[YS1] ). Wukong provides the computational power necessary for running complex simulations and processing large environmental datasets that traditional computing resources would struggle with. 🔍



#### Key advantages of Wukong include:
- 🎯 **Large GPU capacity** for high-resolution ML/differentiable process-based models
- ⚙️ **Scalable parallel processing** capabilities
- 🚀 **Optimized performance** for data-intensive workloads
- ⏳ **Reduced processing time** for big data
- 🌐 **Support for multi-node computation** to handle larger geographical areas

#### **S3 Bucket Integration**: 
To complement Wukong’s computational power, the PSU researchers and AWI DevOps staff implemented **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** buckets as their secondary data storage solution. This integration offers several benefits:
- 🗄️ **Virtually unlimited storage capacity** for growing datasets
- 🔒 **Data durability and redundancy**
- 💰 **Cost-effective long-term storage**, with the use of S3 intelligent tiering to automate the storage cost savings by moving data when access patterns change
- 🔄 **Seamless data transfer** between computing nodes
- 📝 **Version control** for dataset iterations
- 🤝 **Easy data sharing** with users not on Wukong

## 🔬 Research Applications

The PSU team has applied this powerful computing infrastructure to several critical research areas:

1. **National Streamflow Modeling** 🌊  
   Training differentiable hydrologic models with high-resolution forcing and static attribute data across extensive geographical regions using observations from thousands of gauges, followed by whole-domain forwarding.

2. **National River Routing** 🗺️  
   Conducting river routing on MERIT/HydroFabric river networks, combined with neural network-supported routing parameter learning.

3. **NextGen Candidate Models & Data Assimilation** 🔄  
   Applying multiple NextGen candidate models and data assimilation algorithms within the differentiable modeling framework, which supports compliance with [BMI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14827983).

4. **Foundation Model Development** 🏞️  
   Developing a foundation model to explore co-evolution between landscapes.
