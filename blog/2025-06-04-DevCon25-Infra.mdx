The recent DevCon 2025 event showcased not just cutting-edge development practices, but also demonstrated how modern DevOps principles and cloud infrastructure can seamlessly support large-scale technical workshops. Our team had the privilege of providing IT infrastructure and support for over 200 attendees, creating a robust learning environment through an exemplary public-private partnership.

## The Power of Collaboration

DevCon 2025 represented an outstanding example of what's possible when public institutions and private enterprises work together:
- **Corporate Sponsors**: AWS and Google Cloud provided funding and infrastructure for the event.
- **Infrastructure Partners**: NSF JetStream and 2i2c JupyterHub delivered the computational backbone.
- **Technical Implementation**: The CIROH Research Cyberinfrastructure and DevOps Team managed IT access and software packaging.

## Our Technical Approach

Supporting 200+ workshop attendees required careful planning and execution. Our DevOps team and partners implemented:

### Infrastructure as Code
- Automated deployment of workshop environments
- Scalable JupyterHub instances configured for concurrent users
- Pre-packaged software environments ensuring consistency across all workstations

### Cloud-Native Solutions
- Leveraged AWS S3 bucket and Google Cloud BigQuery 
- Implemented auto-scaling to handle peak workshop loads
- Ensured high availability across multiple availability zones

### Seamless User Experience
- Single sign-on authentication for 100+ participants using CIROH 2i2c JupyterHub's new WORKSHOP Hub!!
- Pre-configured JetStream2 environments with all necessary tools
- Real-time support slack channels for immediate issue resolution

### Key Achievements
- **Zero Downtime**: Maintained 100% uptime throughout the entire event
- **Rapid Onboarding**: All 200 attendees were able to access their environments within minutes
- **Consistent Experience**: Every participant had identical, fully-functional development environments
- **Real-time Support**: Our team resolved technical issues with average response time under 5 minutes

## Lessons Learned

This event perfectly demonstrated how DevOps principles—bridging development and operations—combined with cloud computing can transform organizational capabilities. Key takeaways include:
1. **Automation is Essential**: Pre-event automation allowed us to focus on attendee support rather than infrastructure management.
2. **Public-Private Partnerships Work**: Combining Google Cloud services, AWS services, 2i2c services and NSF's research infrastructure created a best-of-class research workshops solution.
3. **Preparation Prevents Problems**: Our extensive pre-event testing and redundancy planning paid dividends during the live event.

## Looking Forward

The success of DevCon 2025's IT infrastructure demonstrates that large-scale technical events no longer need to be limited by traditional IT constraints. By embracing DevOps practices and leveraging cloud partnerships, we can create learning environments that scale effortlessly while maintaining reliability and performance.

We're proud to have supported the DevCon 2025 community and look forward to applying these lessons to future events. The combination of public research infrastructure, private cloud resources, and dedicated DevOps expertise created an environment where 200+ developers could focus on learning and innovation without worrying about technical barriers.
