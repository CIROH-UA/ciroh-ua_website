May was a pivotal month for representing the [Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH)](https://ciroh.ua.edu/) and our collective work in advancing water science. As one of CIROH's Ambassadors, I had the privilege of connecting with the broader scientific community at two key events: the [Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) Congress](https://www.ewricongress.org/) in Anchorage, Alaska, and the [2025 CIROH Developers Conference](https://ciroh.ua.edu/devconference/2025-ciroh-developers-conference/) in Burlington, Vermont.


### Empowering the Community at the [2025 CIROH Developers Conference](https://ciroh.ua.edu/devconference/2025-ciroh-developers-conference/)

The annual [**CIROH Developers Conference**](https://ciroh.ua.edu/devconference/2025-ciroh-developers-conference/) is a premier three-day event that convenes hundreds of scientists, engineers, and software developers from across the consortium and its partner institutions. It serves as a vital hub for innovation and collaboration, where attendees engage with the latest research findings, project highlights, and hands-on workshops on cutting-edge tools, workflows, and methodologies.

For me, this year's conference in the beautiful city of [Burlington, Vermont](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Burlington,+VT/), felt like coming full circle, as it marked my one-year anniversary since joining the consortium through [The University of Alabama](https://www.ua.edu/).

I had the privilege of leading a [hands-on training workshop on hydrological model calibration](https://github.com/skoriche/NGIAB-Calibration-DevCon25). It was a fantastic experience engaging with the talented developers, researchers, and scientists who are all dedicated to the advancement and acceleration of Community Water Resources Modeling. Our session provided comprehensive, hands-on guidance for calibrating one of core components of the NextGen National Water Model model-confifuration‚Äîspecifically the [Conceptial Functional Equivalent (CFE)](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cfe) coupled with [Noah-OWP-Modular](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/noah-owp-modular)‚Äîwithin the [**NextGen In A Box (NGIAB) ecosystem**](https://ngiab.ciroh.org).

The [NGIAB ecosystem](https://ngiab.ciroh.org) is a comprehensive platform that revolutionizes how we approach hydrological research with integrated capabilities for:

* ‚ú® **1. Data preprocessing**
* ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Hydrology model simulations and calibration**
* üìä **3. Advanced evaluation tools**
* üìà **4. Rich visualization capabilities**

A huge thank you to [CIROH](https://ciroh.ua.edu/) for organizing such an insightful conference, and to the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/) for being an excellent host!

For everyone who attended or is interested in learning more, all training materials, codes, and data from the workshop are openly available in our GitHub repository:

‚û°Ô∏è **More NextGen Workshops**: [DocuHub News](/news); May 2025 Updates

I'm inspired by the passion for innovation shown and look forward to seeing how the community leverages these tools to advance water modeling.

### Disseminating Research at the [EWRI Congress](https://www.ewricongress.org/)

The EWRI Congress was a valuable opportunity to disseminate our research and connect with hundreds of engineers and scientists. I had the privilege of delivering three oral presentations that showcase the use-inspired science outcomes emerging from the CIROH Science and Technology Team and our partners.

#### [1. Advancing Hydrologic Modeling through Community-Driven Development: The NextGen Framework](https://github.com/CIROH-UA)

This [presentation](https://alaska2025.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?efp=SUlaTkJWTUEyNDE5NA&PresentationID=1583570&rnd=0.1763265&mode=presInfo) introduced the Community NextGen initiative, a collaborative effort aimed at fostering open innovation and accelerating the framework's development. These efforts aim to facilitate efficient research-to-operations (R2O) and operations-to-research (O2R) transitions, ultimately enhancing our ability to model and predict water resources at various scales.

#### [2. Enhancing Catchment Based Hydrological Model Performance through Dynamic Sub-Discretization Using Land Surface Attributes](https://alaska2025.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?PresentationID=1583638&mode=presInfo)

This talk addressed how the simplifications in lumped models can lead to reduced accuracy when applied uniformly in catchments with significant land-surface heterogeneity. The study explores the potential to enhance lumped model performance by introducing dynamic discretization based on key land-surface heterogeneities such as land use, soil type and soil layering, slope aspect, and elevation.

#### [3. Multi-model Predictions of Design Low Flow Conditions in the Great Salt Lake Basin Using NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework](https://alaska2025.eventscribe.net/fsPopup.asp?efp=SUlaTkJWTUEyNDE5NA&PresentationID=1603025&rnd=0.5338731&mode=presInfo)

This research focused on the challenge of accurately estimating low flow conditions in ungauged basins, such as those in the Great Salt Lake (GSL) region. The study paves the way to investigate how different models perform in predicting design low flow, a critical standard for water supply planning, management, and ensuring water quality in the GSL basin at both gauged and ungauged locations.

These works directly reflects the ongoing efforts and use-inspired science outcomes of the¬†[CIROH¬†Science and Technology Team and Partners across the consortium](https://ngiab.ciroh.org/#:~:text=Alabama-,Water,-Institute). The congress served as a successful platform for showcasing these advancements and CIROH's leadership in community-driven, next-generation water resource prediction.
