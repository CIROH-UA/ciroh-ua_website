The 15th Biennial National Hydrologic Warning Conference (NHWC 2025), held June 16–20 in Tucson, Arizona, brought together experts from across the water and emergency management community to address challenges in flood forecasting, climate adaptation, and hydrologic science. CIROH made a strong impression, with multiple researchers presenting groundbreaking work and fostering connections with operational forecasters, emergency managers, and fellow scientists.

## Advancing Model Reliability in Hydrologic Forecasting

During the “Advancing Model Reliability” session, moderated by Dr. Steve Burian, CIROH researchers focused on improving evaluation techniques for hydrologic models—particularly in the context of the National Water Model (NWM).

Dr. Md Shahabul Alam, representing CIROH at the University of Alabama, delivered a compelling talk titled **“Rethinking Model Reliability: A Dual Evaluation of NWM Using Time Series and Extreme Events.”** His presentation emphasized the need for robust evaluation approaches that span both routine and extreme conditions, offering a clearer view into how the model performs across varying scenarios.

This work directly supports CIROH’s mission to improve operational forecasting tools under evolving climate conditions and contribute to more reliable, actionable predictions.

## Spotlight on the NextGen Program

CIROH also took a leading role in the **NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework** track, which supports the National Weather Service’s vision for modernizing water prediction tools.

**Edwin Welles** from Deltares USA opened the track with an overview of the Office of Water Prediction’s initiative to implement a nationwide system for flood inundation mapping, supported by Raytheon and Deltares.

**Arpita Patel** continued this conversation with her talk, *“Navigating the NextGen Ecosystem and NextGen In A Box (NGIAB).”* Her presentation explored how the NGIAB platform lowers the barrier for researchers, forecasters, and water managers to access and deploy advanced modeling tools. Her efforts embody CIROH’s goal of democratizing hydrologic science and expanding adoption of cutting-edge technologies.

## CIROH Leads the Leaderboard

Beyond the presentations, CIROH’s presence was strongly felt in the conference community. Using the Whova app’s interactive leaderboard, CIROH researchers were top contributors:

- 🥇 **Md Shahabul Alam** earned **1st place** with 194,700 points, maintaining a commanding lead throughout the week and drawing daily attention from attendees.
- 🥉 **Arpita Patel** secured **3rd place** with 70,200 points, reflecting her active engagement and leadership across technical and social conference activities.

Their achievements highlighted not only technical excellence but also the energy and visibility CIROH brings to the broader hydrologic community.

## Growing Community Impact

Both talks drew significant interest from attendees, particularly around the **NextGen In A Box** tool. Participants praised its ease of deployment, modular structure, and ability to integrate with a variety of datasets—factors that make it well-suited for both research and operational forecasting.

These interactions underscore CIROH’s growing reputation as a bridge between cutting-edge science and real-world impact. By engaging directly with the forecasting and emergency management community, our researchers are shaping the tools and approaches used to manage water resources and extreme events.

## Looking Ahead

CIROH’s strong presence at NHWC 2025 illustrates our ongoing commitment to collaboration, innovation, and community-oriented science. As we continue to push the boundaries of hydrologic modeling and forecasting, conferences like NHWC are critical venues for showcasing our progress, receiving feedback, and forging the partnerships that advance both research and resilience.
