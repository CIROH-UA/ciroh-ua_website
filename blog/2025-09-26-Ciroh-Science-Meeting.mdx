## Meeting Highlights: Transforming Research into Real-World Impact

Over four days, our community showed how scientific innovation translates into tools and systems that support communities, enhance resilience, and improve decision-making across the nation. From AI advances in water prediction to flood inundation mapping, the presentations and discussions demonstrated the collaborative, open-science approach that defines CIROH.
