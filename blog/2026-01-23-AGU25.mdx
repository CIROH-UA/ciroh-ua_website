As we do every year, the CIROH team took on the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Annual Meeting 2025 by storm. The Amtrak shuttled us from famously frigid Tuscaloosa to balmy New Orleans, where we *laissâmes les bons temps rouler* a few months early. From December 15-19, our team shared presentations and posters (and beignets and Cajun food), demonstrating CIROH's commitment to advancing hydrologic science, open collaboration, and sharing technological advancements.

## **Where Science Connects Us**


All good event attendees embrace the theme, and we happen to be great event attendees. This year's AGU theme, "Where Science Connects Us," aligned with CIROH's mission to democratize water modeling and foster community engagement in hydrologic research. Our presentations highlighted how we use containerization, cloud infrastructure, and collaborative frameworks in the world of operational and research hydrology. We also loved connecting with the broader CIROH community through the CIROH Research Exchange (lovingly dubbed T-REX by our talented events team), our biggest exhibit hall booth to date, a very packed poster presentation caravan led by our fearless Steve Burian, Martyn Clark, and Katie van Werkhoven, and, in classic AGU fashion, running into colleagues randomly in the extremely long convention center hallways

## **Reflections**

AGU is a wild world. It’s incredible how you can pack the population of a small town into one onvention center and still have room left to spare. It’s even more incredible that at seemingly every turn, we always recognized at least a few citizens of said small town. We had such a wonderful time getting to see old friends and make new ones and come away from each conversation with a new idea for how CIROH Science Team could collaborate with the community.

Our team was so encouraged by the number of presentations and posters we saw that used our community resources like our NGIAB container and our high-performance computing cyberinfrastructure offerings like Pantarhei and Wukong. (Perhaps you were one of our 13,101 NGIAB Docker deployments?) Not mentioned in the brief list above are all the presentations we got to see about model developments for the NextGen Framework. We love supporting our member and partner institutions’ research-to-operations work with our cyberinfrastructure resource offerings and community resource repositories like the [Data Preprocessor](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB_data_preprocess), [TEEHR](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngiab-teehr), and the [Tethys Visualizer](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngiab-teehr). We would also love to showcase that work in our NextGen Research Datastream, running every hour for all of CONUS on AWS. If you’ve got a model that you’d like included in NGIAB and/or NRDS, we are more than happy to chat about it (or read through your GitHub issues submitted through our model integration issue form). We’re excited to get to work this year and support you and all of your R2O dreams!


## **Community Resources**

## **Join the Community and Get Involved**

Did AGU leave you wanting more from CIROH? We might not be able to see all of you in person every day (we miss y’all already), but whether you're a hydrologist, software developer, data scientist, or agency partner, there are many ways to get involved.

- **Try NGIAB**: Download from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/awiciroh/ciroh-ngen-image) or access [NGIAB 101](https://docs.ciroh.org/training-NGIAB-101/) for more details
- **Contribute Models to NGIAB**: Submit BMI-compliant models integration request through our [model integration issue form](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra/issues) under the “New issue” button.
- **Calibrate Models**: Use our [calibration tools](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngiab-cal) to calibrate models for your favorite watersheds (we all have those, don’t pretend like you don’t know what we’re talking about!)
- **Share Feedback**: Open [GitHub issues](https://github.com/CIROH-UA) to report bugs and suggest improvements, or join our Community Resources Working Group discussions
- **Slack Channel**: Join our public slack channels for community discussions
- **Working Groups**: Participate in one (or more, for you overachievers) of [CIROH’s working groups](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/07569d6285f643c1a57fd18daab98f7e) – Artificial Intellgience, Community Resources, Decision Support, Early Career, Flood Inundation Mapping, Hydroinformatics, Hydrologic Modeling, Model and Forecast Evaluation
- **Student Summer Education Programs**: Are you/do you know any undergraduates interested in AI and operational hydrology who are looking for research experiences over the summer? [We have an REU for exactly that.](https://graduate.ua.edu/academics/summer-research-programs-for-undergraduate-students/ai-for-operational-hydrology/) Applications are due March 1. (Side effects: students may leave as Alabama football fans. Roll Tide!!)
- **DevCon**: Attend yearly Developer Conference in May. DevCon 2026 is in Salt Lake City, UT from May 27-29.

The AGU25 presentations represent the collective effort of researchers, developers, and operational forecasters working together to advance hydrologic science. They are a culmination of months and years of dedication and love for science and research. Thank you to everyone who said hi, visited our posters, attended our presentations, and engaged in discussions about the future of water modeling. We’ll see you next year in San Francisco!
