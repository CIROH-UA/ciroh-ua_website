# NextGen Framework - multi-BMI Model Formulations

Building Novel & Mimic Model Formulations using the NextGen Framework: Need for Metamodel Description Language & BMI Programming Standards

## Speaker:  Fred L. Ogden, Ph.D., P.E., Chief Scientist (ST), NOAA/NWS Office of Water Prediction

The Basic Model Interface (BMI) standard employed Next Generation Water Resources Modeling (NextGen) framework allows construction of mimic and novel model formulations.  Doing so involves ordered execution of modules designed to simulate individual processes or fluxes and performing integration of these over time on various control volumes to simulate the temporal evolution of model states.  These are called "multi-BMI" formulations.  Presently, order of execution of modules making up a multi-BMI model formulation depends on the ordering of modules in the run realization file.  This presentation shows model/module developments undertaken to date in this regard.  Knowledge gaps and needs are discussed, with a few suggestions regarding potential coding standards leading to modules that allow monitoring of conservation law enforcement at the framework level for different model formulations that use a variety of internal discretizations.
