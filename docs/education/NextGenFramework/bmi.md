BMI is a middleware, a software that operates between other components (in this case, NextGen). It standardizes model querying, control, and coupling. 

From the [BMI wiki](https://bmi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):
<blockquote>
We believe that numerical models, and the sub-components that make up those models,
should offer....standardization. To this end, the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling
System (CSDMS) has developed the Basic Model Interface (BMI): a set of **standard
control and query functions** that, when added to a model code, make that model both
easier to learn and easier to couple with other software elements.
</blockquote>

## Key Features of BMI
- Control model runtime using standardized functions
- Pass data in/out of models using standardized functions
- Provide model and variable information
- Work in multiple languages and models.
