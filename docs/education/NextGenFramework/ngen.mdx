ngen: Next Generation Water Modeling Engine and Framework Prototype

ngen is a model agnostic framework designed for building and integrating models rather than being a model itself. It focuses on a data-centric process that abstracts the addition of processes and data behind a standard. This design allows for greater flexibility and standardization in model creation and integration.

## Key Features of ngen:
- Model Agnostic: ngen is not a specific model but rather a framework for building and integrating different models.
- Data-Centric: ngen emphasizes a data-centric approach, ensuring that data is central to the modeling process.
- Flexible and Standardized: ngen provides a standardized approach to model creation and integration, allowing for greater flexibility and ease of use.
