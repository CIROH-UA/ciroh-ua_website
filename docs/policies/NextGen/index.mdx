## Introduction

This document provides technical guidance for including models and modules in the Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen). It covers essential aspects of model integration, best practices, and framework requirements.

## Key Points

- NextGen is a model-agnostic, standards-based framework for water resources modeling
- It allows for flexible experimentation with hydrologic cycle representations
- The framework supports explicit coupling of models through sharing of computed states and fluxes
- Design requirements include maximum flexibility, open-source development, and multi-language support
