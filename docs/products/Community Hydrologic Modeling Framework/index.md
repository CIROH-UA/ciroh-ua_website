Community NextGen is a community-accessible verison of NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework ([NextGen](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen)). It simplifies deployment with a one-click containerization. NGIAB offers both Docker-based cloud infrastructure ([NGIAB-CloudInfra](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra/blob/main/README.md)) and Singularity-based high-performance computing ([NGIAB-HPCInfra](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-HPCInfra/blob/main/README.md)). NGIAB includes essential tools such as [Data Preprocess](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB_data_preprocess/blob/main/README.md), which simplifies data preparation with its interactive map, and [Data Visualizer](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngiab-client), which provides geospatial and time series visualization. With [NextGen Datastream](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/blob/main/README.md) you can build and validate NextGen input packages, execute NextGen through NGIAB and version the entire run for reproducibility.
