# CSES

Community Streamflow Evaluation System (CSES) is a Python-based, user friendly, fast, and model agnostic streamflow evaluator tool. This tool can be used to evaluate any hydrological model that uses NHDPlus dataset. It allows a user to evaluate the performance of a hydrological model at the collocated USGS gauges and NHDPlus stream reaches. This Python-based tool helps visualize the results and investigate the model performance interactively. The current version of the tool is available on GitHub and can be accessed using the following link.
