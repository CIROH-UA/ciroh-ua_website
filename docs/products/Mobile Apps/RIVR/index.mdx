## Introduction to the CIROH RIVR App

Welcome to the RIVR App, your go-to tool for real-time and forecast river flow information. Whether you're a kayaker, fisherman, or hydrologist, RIVR provides critical data to help you plan and understand river conditions. With the RIVR App, you can monitor river levels, access short-term and long-term forecasts, and manage a list of your favorite rivers for quick access.

## Background of the US NWM Streamflow Forecasts

The RIVR App utilizes streamflow forecasts generated by the National Water Model (NWM). The NWM is a hydrologic model for the United States that simulates the water cycle, including streamflow, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. By leveraging the NWM, RIVR provides users with up-to-date and scientifically sound river flow predictions.

## Finding Rivers using the Map Interface

The RIVR App offers a map interface to find river monitoring stations:

1.  Upon opening the "Add River" section, you'll see a map with location markers.
2.  Zoom in or out to explore different areas.
3.  Markers indicate river monitoring stations. Tap on a marker to see more details. You may be able to also search for a place in the search bar, such as "Louisiana".
4.  Choose from different map views such as "Streets," "Outdoors," "Light," "Standard," and "Satellite".
5.  You will also be able to search by distance or name.

## Editing and Managing Your List of Favorite Rivers

Manage your list of rivers within the RIVR App:

1.  Your list of favorite rivers will be shown in the "My Rivers" section.
2.  If you have no favorite rivers yet, you'll be notified. You can add rivers from the map interface (see "Finding Rivers using the Map Interface").
3.  To add a river to favorites, navigate to the river details and click the "Add to Favorites" or equivalent button.

## Viewing Forecasts for a Specific River

To access detailed forecasts for a river:

1.  Select a river from your "My Rivers" list, or choose it from the map interface.
2.  You'll be taken to the river's detail page, where you can view current flow, flow status, and forecast information.
3.  The river's name and location (e.g., Louisville, Kentucky) will be displayed.
4.  Current flow is shown in ft³/s.
5.  Flow status (e.g., "Low") indicates the current condition.
6.  Return period information is available showing 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year flow benchmarks.
7.  Hydrographs (graphs of flow over time) are provided for different ranges.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/products/ciroh-rivr/17.png').default} style={{maxHeight: "30rem"}} />

## Hourly (Short Range) Forecasts

Hourly forecasts provide detailed short-range flow predictions:

1.  Select the "Hourly" tab or option on the river's detail page.
2.  See the hourly flow forecast in ft³/s for the next few hours.
3.  View the hourly hydrograph, which shows predicted flow over time. The graph may be available in different view options such as "Wave View".

<img src={require('@site/static/img/products/ciroh-rivr/19.png').default} style={{maxHeight: "30rem"}} />

## Daily (Medium Range) Forecasts

Daily forecasts give medium-range flow predictions:

1.  Select the "Daily" tab or option on the river's detail page.
2.  View the daily flow forecast for the next several days.
3.  See the daily hydrograph showing predicted flow trends over the next few days.
