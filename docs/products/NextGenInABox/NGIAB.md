# NextGen In A Box (NGIAB)

NextGen framework-based simulations are now easy with NextGen In A Box!

Github URL: https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra/

Containerized "NextGen In a Box" (NGIAB) is a community-accessible version of the NextGen National Water Resources Modeling Framework.

The key accomplishment of this research effort is the development and dissemination of NextGen In a Box (NGIAB), a community-accessible port of the NextGen framework. In addition to enhancing research infrastructure, this project places a strong emphasis on fostering and promoting the integration of NextGen Framework within the broader research community.

With this development, and the accompanying training sessions, many researchers are now making much more rapid progress towards new developments in the NextGen framework and we expect this to lead quickly to improvements in the operational performance of upcoming versions of the Operational National Water Model.

It is a NextGen National Water Resources Modeling Framework Community Release

- Provides capabilities to run the Next Generation National Water Resources Modeling framework on your local machine for any size watershed.

## We are doing a case study : 
### NWM run for Sipsey Fork,Black Warrior river

- We donâ€™t want to run all of CONUS
- We want to run NextGen locally
- We want to have control over inputs / config.
- How can we do it? Answer: **NextGen In A Box**

## How to run the NextGen In A Box for your sample input data?

Follow the steps in README.md located at :
https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra/blob/main/README.md
