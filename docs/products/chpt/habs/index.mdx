# Harmful Algal Bloom Predictions: An Introduction

CIROH has supported the cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (cyanoHABs) 
forecasting research team at the University of Vermont (PI Asim Zia). Dr. Zia’s team has 
over 10 years of experience in the prediction of cyanoHABs using ground-based 
observational data products and meteorological and hydrological forecast products such 
as the National Water Model. This team has begun to integrate 
satellite data products into their cyanoHABs forecasting workflows. In addition, Dr. Zia 
and UVM’s Dr. Patrick Clemins led the Northeast Evaluation Testbed for Water 
Resource Applications (NETWA; https://uvm.edu/water/netwa), a CIROH-funded 
project. NETWA has created 

(1) data acquisition tools to help researchers access 
forecast and observational data products relevant to water resources prediction, 

(2) 
computational workflows for forecasting that can utilize high-performance computing to 
simulate large numbers of scenarios in parallel, 

(3) experimental protocol templates, 
and 

(4) a community of practice for the use of advanced research computing and data 
techniques to further water resource prediction research.
