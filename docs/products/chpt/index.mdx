# CIROH Hydrologic Prediction Testbed (CHPT): An Introduction

The CIROH Hydrologic Prediction Testbed project at the Colorado 
School of Mines (CSM) has established a multi-faceted activity known as the CIROH 
Hydrologic Prediction Testbed (CHPT). CHPT is designed to facilitate the community 
benchmarking of research efforts related to operational hydrologic prediction. This 
overarching effort is working to promote the adoption of community-based experimental 
“protocols” and standards for research areas in which a critical mass of projects 
designed to advance different aspects of operational forecasting are underway. The 
CHPT does not currently include any ecologically-oriented protocols, yet ecological 
forecasting is a widespread operational activity that yields demonstrable value to 
society. 

## Getting Started with CHPT

To get started with CHPT select a class of data from 
list and explore the prediction protocols defined for
that area of study.
