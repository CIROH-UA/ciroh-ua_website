# Forecast Data Overlay


# About

This preprocessor-based visualizer uses a python/flask backend to run an html frontend, and requests forcing data to display over the map of CONUS. It can handle either single time steps or ranges of lead times, and can animate the received data.

The setup for this project is largely identical to the uv-specific installation of the NGIAB_data_preprocess, with the caveat that this project is not currently a package and cannot be automatically installed.
