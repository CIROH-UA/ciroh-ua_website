2. For an example usage, please refer to [this script](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/api-nwm-gcp/blob/main/examples/notebooks/nwm_usgs_streamflow_plot.ipynb). Replace your API key and API_URL = 'https://nwm-api.ciroh.org'.

3. Estimate the costs of your query before running the actual query. If you're not sure how to approach this step, please contact [CIROH IT support](mailto:ciroh-it-support@ua.edu).

:::note
The NWM BigQuery API is available for free to CIROH members and partners who have active CIROH projects. The cost-estimate step above is strictly to ensure that CIROH can continue to provide this service in the long-term.
