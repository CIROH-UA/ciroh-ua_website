# HydroShare

[HydroShare](https://www.hydroshare.org) is a collaboration environment and repository for data, models, and other research products. Developed and maintained by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI), HydroShare is a file agnostic, general purpose repository for data, models, computational notebooks, and other content types that accepts upload of any file type. HydroShare allows users to publish data and other content and receive a citable Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Users can keep content files private, share individually with collaborators, make content public, or publish content permanently so that it can be easily cited. HydroShare users can also share their content with groups and communities, such as the [CIROH Community](https://www.hydroshare.org/community/4/), allowing for increased inter-group collaboration. Reach out to help@cuahsi.org for more information or see [https://help.hydroshare.org/](https://help.hydroshare.org/).

## Software and Technologies

HydroShare is an operational repository at [https://www.hydroshare.org](https://www.hydroshare.org). HydroShare includes the following functionality:

- A user-oriented web application for creation of "resources" within which you can share data, models, computational notebooks, and other content files.
- A flexible, file-based data model for storing content created within HydroShare resources.
- A REST application programming interface (API) for programmatic access to HydroShare resources. You can automate and code most everything through HydroShare's API that you can do through the web user interface.
- A Python client package called "hsclient" that enables easier interaction with HydroShare's REST API
- Ability to link to and launch computational notebooks, code, and content files into linked JupyterHub environments, including the CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub, CUASHI JupyterHub, and CyberGIS JupyterHub.

## Access

Anyone can access HydroShare by navigating to [https://www.hydroshare.org](https://www.hydroshare.org) and creating a user account. All users are automatically allocated a 20GB quota for content within HydroShare, but if you need more space you can make a request to CUAHSI.
