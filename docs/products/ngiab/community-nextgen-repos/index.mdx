# Community NextGen Repositories

---

This section surfaces open-source repositories that are integrated in NextGen In A Box (NGIAB).

Several of these repositories are forks that haven't recieved significant attention to their READMEs.
As such, unlike most projects, these READMEs are not currently mirrored to DocuHub.

If you just want to use these projects' functionality at a high level, [NGIAB-CloudInfra's documentation](/docs/products/ngiab/distributions/ngiab-docker/) is likely a better starting point.
