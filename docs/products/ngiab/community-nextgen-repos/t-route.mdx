## Summary

T-Route is a Python package for generating channel networks from digital elevation models (DEMs). It uses a tree-based approach to identify and connect channels, resulting in realistic and hydrologically consistent channel networks.

### Key Features of T-Route:
- Tree-Based Approach: T-Route uses a tree-based algorithm to identify and connect channels, ensuring hydrologically consistent channel networks.
- High-Resolution DEMs: T-Route can generate channel networks from high-resolution DEMs, capturing detailed channel morphology.
- Flexible and Extensible: T-Route provides a flexible framework for customizing the channel generation process and extending its capabilities.
