## Working with HydroShare, AORC data, HydroFabric and NextGen on CIROH JupyterHub Tutorial

This HydroShare resource provides a tutorial on the use of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) HydroShare repository and linked CIROH JupyterHub computing platform on 2i2c in support of CIROH collaborative research and NextGen modeling. It introduces use of Jupyter Notebooks for retrieval of NOAA Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) datasets and setting up and executing NextGen for a small test watershed as a starting point for research with NextGen.


You can find the resource here: [https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/fc8539358fe64ca6a47468728a0687a1/](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/fc8539358fe64ca6a47468728a0687a1/)


To open the resource in CIROH JupyterHub, click the "Open with..." button on the HydroShare page and select "CIROH JupyterHub":

## Command Line Examples

Here are some command-line examples related to working with the data:

```bash
# Virtual environment
source /ngen/.venv/bin/activate
python -m ngiab_data_cli -i "gage-10109001" -s
# Hydrofabric
python -m ngiab_data_cli -i "cat-2861446" -s
# Forcing
python -m ngiab_data_cli -i "cat-2861446" -f --start "2021-10-01" --end "2022-09-30"
# Configuration
python -m ngiab_data_cli -i "cat-2861446" -r --start "2021-10-01" --end "2022-09-30"
