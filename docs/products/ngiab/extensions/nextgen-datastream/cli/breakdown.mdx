# DataStreamCLI Breakdown

:::warning
This document is primarily intended to explain what steps DataStreamCLI performs internally.  
Performing these steps manually is discouraged, as a typical call to `scripts/datastream` will handle all of this for you.  
If you're looking for a guide for how to run the script, run `scripts/datastream-guide` after [installation](/docs/products/ngiab/extensions/nextgen-datastream/cli/install) for an interactive tutorial.
