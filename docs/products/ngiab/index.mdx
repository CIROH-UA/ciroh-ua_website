NextGen In A Box is a community-accessible verison of NextGen Water Resources Modeling Framework ([NextGen](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen)).
It simplifies deployment through containerization, which allows the entire NextGen workflow to be run using just a single script.
Additionally, the broader NextGen In A Box ecosystem offers essential tools to improve, validate, and visualize your models at every stage of the process.

### Deployment Options
- [**NGIAB-CloudInfra**](/docs/products/ngiab/distributions/ngiab-docker): A Docker-based NGIAB distribution suitable for both local and cloud-based workflows. ([Installation](/docs/products/ngiab/intro/install))
- [**NGIAB-HPCInfra**](/docs/products/ngiab/distributions/ngiab-singularity): A Singularity-based NGIAB distribution suitable for high-performance computing (HPC) environments.
- [**NextGen on CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub**](/docs/products/ngiab/distributions/nextgen-2i2c): A dedicated image on CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub for running NextGen In A Box.

### Core Components
- [**Data Preprocess**](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-preprocessor): Simplifies data preparation for the NGIAB workflow through an interactive map interface and straightforward command line tools.
- [**TEEHR Evaluation**](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-teehr): Provides comprehensive model evaluation capabilities.
- [**Data Visualizer**](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-visualizer): Delivers sophisticated geospatial and time series visualization.
- [**NGIAB Calibration**](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-calibration): Offers intuitive calibration for models in NGIAB workflows, including the CFE and NOAH-OWP modules.
