## Concepts and Terms

### Catchment

### Calibration
The process of tuning a hydrologic model's parameters to more accurately match observed outcomes.

The NGIAB ecosystem offers the [NGIAB Calibration](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-calibration) utility to streamline this process.

### Containerization

### Hydrofabric

### Nexus

### Realization

## File Formats

### Geopackage (`.gpkg`)

### Tarball (`.tar.gz`)
A common archive format among Linux users. Analogous to formats like `.zip` and `.rar`, it allows for folders of content to be shared as a downloadable file.

## Tools and Software

### Basic Modeling Interface (BMI)

A standardized set of function and parameter bindings that allow models to interact with external components in a predictable, modular way.

BMI has been adopted as the standard for models compatible with the NextGen framework. Documentation for BMI is available [here](https://bmi.csdms.io/en/stable/).
