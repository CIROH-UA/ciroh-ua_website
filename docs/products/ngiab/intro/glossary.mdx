## Concepts and Terms

### Catchment
A specific, contiguous geographic area from which precipitation collects and drains into an output point like a river or water body. In hydrologic modeling, these catchments offer natural geographic subdivisions for localized modeling and outputs.

Also known as a [**watershed**](#watershed) or **drainage basin**.

Note that catchment identifiers may not be persistent across hydrofabrics. Instead, [points of interest](#point-of-interest) should be used as persistent identifiers.

### Calibration
The process of tuning a hydrologic model's parameters to more accurately match observed outcomes.

The NGIAB ecosystem offers the [NGIAB Calibration](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-calibration) utility to streamline this process.

### Channel Routing
Predicting the magnitude and shape of a [hydrograph](#hydrograph) as water moves through waterways.

### CONUS
Common shorthand for the **Con**tinental **U**nited **S**tates.

### Discharge
The rate at which water flows through a channel, measured in units of volume/time (e.g. cubic meters per second (CMS), cubic feet per second (CFS)). Also referred to as **[streamflow](#streamflow)**.

### Evaluation
The process of assessing the quality and performance of a hydrologic model.

The NGIAB ecosystem offers [integration](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-teehr) with the [TEEHR](#teehr) toolkit to streamline this process.

### Forcing
Values provided as inputs for a hydrologic model. The term comes from the practice of experimentally "forcing" certain input values by overriding the usual flow of data into a model.

### Formulation
A subset of model definitions within a NextGen model [realization](#realization).

### Gage
Short for a stream gauge or streamgage. Fixed locations where streamflow properties such as water level and streamflow are measured and recorded.

### Hydrofabric
Broadly speaking, a hydrofabric defines the physical hydrology of a region, allowing for the region to be modeled.
These hydrofabrics are defined by physical attributes and the links between those attributes.

*For the R library, see "[Hydrofabric (R library)](#hydrofabric-r-library)".*  
*For the hydrofabric used as a baseline by most NextGen models, see "[USGS-NOAA Reference Fabric](#usgs-noaa-reference-fabric)".*

### Hydrograph
A graph that depicts streamflow at a specific location over time.

### Hydrologic Signature
Quantitative metrics that define streamflow, such as maximum flow, baseflow, mean flow, or slope.

### Nexus
A point of data exchange within a NextGen-compatible hydrofabric network. Nexuses are placed at endpoint locations where water flows to within a [catchment](#catchment), such as along its borders.

Note that nexus IDs may not be persistent across hydrofabrics. Instead, [points of interest](#point-of-interest) should be used as persistent identifiers.

### Point of Interest
A physical position that is being used in a model or hydrofabric, such as a [gage](#gage) location. Points of interest are tracked by a wide variety of sources,
including the Army Corp National Inventory of Dams and the USGS Gages III database.

Within the [USGS-NOAA reference fabric](#usgs-noaa-reference-fabric), points of interest are given a persistent POI identifier to allow for tracking across hydrofabric versions.

### Realization
The instructions that tell the NextGen Framework how to run a simulation.

Realizations are stored in model realization files. These files contain [formulations](#formulation) of modules, along with the order in which those modules should be run. Exact specifications for NextGen realizations are provided in the [NGIAB-CloudInfra documentation](/docs/products/ngiab/distributions/ngiab-docker/specifications/realizations).

### Streamflow
In a general sense, the way that water flows through a channel. When referenced as a metric, it refers specifically to [discharge](#discharge).

### Subsetting
The practice of taking a subset of a larger dataset. Subsetting is both common and highly recommended for model runs, as it can greatly reduce the computational load required.

Both GUI and command-line utilities for subsetting the NextGen reference fabric are available within the [Data Preprocess](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-preprocessor/) utility.

### Surface runoff
Unconfined flow of water over the ground surface.

### Vector Processing Unit (VPU)
Regional discretizations used by the [USGS-NOAA reference fabric](#usgs-noaa-reference-fabric). These VPUs designate fixed regions for model runs and data collections.

Somewhat related to [catchments](#catchment), though VPUs are significantly larger and act as collections of contiguous catchments.

### Watershed
In North American English: See [catchment].  
In other English dialects: Typically refers to a *drainage divide line*, or an area of elevated land that separates neighboring drainage basins. Also known as a *height of land* in North American English.

*As CIROH is a United States-based organization, the term "watershed" typically refers to catchments within CIROH projects, websites, and other materials.*

## File Formats

### Geopackage (`.gpkg`)
An open, non-proprietary data format for geographic inforamtion systems. NextGen uses geopackages to contain [hydrofabrics](#hydrofabric).

### JSON (`.json`)
Short for "JavaScript Object Notation", JSON files are used to store objects consisting of name-value pairs. Despite the name, JSON sees wide use in non-JavaScript contexts.

NextGen uses JSON to store its model [realization](#realization) files (`ngen-run/config/realization.json`), which tell the NextGen engine how to execute a model run.

### Model Run Directory (NGIAB)
A standardized format for defining and importing NGIAB model runs. Exact specifications are provided in the [NGIAB-CloudInfra documentation](/docs/products/ngiab/distributions/ngiab-docker/specifications/run-directories).

### NetCDF (`.nc`)
An open standard for arrays of scientific data. NextGen uses the netCDF-4 standard to contain model variable metadata.

### Tarball (`.tar.gz`)
A common archive format among Linux users. Analogously to formats like `.zip` and `.rar`, it allows for folders of content to be shared as a downloadable file.

### YAML (`.yaml`/`.yml`)
Short for "Yet Another Markup Language", YAML files are typically used to store metadata.
NextGen uses a YAML file to store run configurations (`ngen-run/config/ngen.yaml`).

## BMI Models

### t-route
A dynamic channel routing model using in determining routing for river networks. T-route is BMI-compliant and is used to prepare hydrofabrics for both the National Water Model and NGIAB.

Information on t-route is available [here](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/t-route).

## Tools and Software

### Basic Modeling Interface (BMI)

A standardized set of function and parameter bindings that allow models to interact with external components in a predictable, modular way.

BMI has been adopted as the standard for models compatible with the NextGen framework. Documentation for BMI is available [here](https://bmi.csdms.io/en/stable/).

### CIROH Community Hydrofabric

A fork of the [NextGen Hydrofabric](#usgs-noaa-reference-fabric) optimized for performance with the NGIAB ecosystem. While it is currently used as a source hydrofabric, it will eventually be superceded as the reference hydrofabric matures.

Updates to this fork are managed by the [Community Hydrofabric Patcher](/docs/products/ngiab/components/community-hydrofabric/).

### Data Preprocess (NGIAB)

A Python-based tool that automates the process of preparing a [model run directory](#model-run-directory) for NGIAB. See its [documentation](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-preprocessor) for more information.

### Data Visualizer (NGIAB)

A (Tethys)[#tethys-platform]-based application that visualizes NGIAB model outputs, including map-based navigation of gage locations and graphing of both model and baseline time-series. See its [documentation](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-tethys) for more information.

### Hydrofabric (R library)
A standard library maintained by NOAA-OWP for processing and updating [hydrofabrics](#hydrofabric) in R.

Information on Hydrofabric is available [here](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrofabric).

### National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus)
A comprehensive reference [hydrofabric](#hydrofabric) for the United States, maintained by the EPA and USGS. [NHDPlusV2](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/get-nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus-data) is the most current and relevant version.

Relevant to NextGen due to its use as a base for the [NextGen Hydrofabric](#usgs-noaa-reference-fabric). As such, many tools and utilities designed for the NHD and its descendents will also work for NextGen hydrofabrics.

### NextGen Hydrofabric

See [USGS-NOAA Reference Fabric](#usgs-noaa-reference-fabric).

### ngen
The [NextGen model engine](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen). NGIAB provides an [optimized fork](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen) of this software.

### NGIAB-CloudInfra

[NGIAB's Docker-based distribution](/docs/products/ngiab/distributions/ngiab-docker/). It is suitable for the vast majority of purposes, including both local and cloud computing.

### NGIAB-HPCInfra

[NGIAB's Singularity-based distribution](/docs/products/ngiab/distributions/ngiab-singularity/). It is preferable in high-performance computing environments that benefit from Singularity's HPC-centric design.

### TEEHR
Short for "Tools for Exploratory Evolution in Hydrologic Research", TEEHR is a Python library that provides comprehensive tooling for model [evaluation](#evaluation). TEEHR is [included as a part of the NGIAB ecosystem](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-teehr).

Information on TEEHR is available [here](https://rtiinternational.github.io/teehr/).

### TEEHR Integration (NGIAB)

A containerized component within the NGIAB workflow that automates baseline evaluation of streamflow outputs. See its [documentation](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-teehr) for more information.

### Tethys Platform
Tethys is a Python-based platform for building geospatial web apps. It forms the core of NGIAB's [Data Visualizer](/docs/products/ngiab/components/ngiab-visualizer), alongside many other CIROH applications.

Information on the Tethys Platform is available [here](https://www.tethysplatform.org/).

### USGS-NOAA Reference Fabric
A [hydrofabric](#hydrofabric) jointly developed by the NOAA, USGS, and Lynker Spatial, which provides a shared baseline for NextGen models. More commonly known as the **NextGen Hydrofabric**.

Implementation and usage information for this fabric is available [here](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/articles/02-design-deep-dive.html).
