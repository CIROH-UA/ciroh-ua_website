### Windows:
1. **Install WSL:** Head over to Microsoft's official documentation and follow their comprehensive guide on installing WSL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
2. **Install Docker Desktop:** Begin by downloading and installing Docker Desktop from the official website: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#install-docker-desktop-on-windows
3. **Start Docker Desktop:** After installation, launch the Docker Desktop application.
4. **Open WSL as Admin:** Right-click on the WSL icon and select "Run as Administrator".
5. **Verify Installation:** In the WSL window, type the command docker ps -a to check if Docker is running correctly. This command should display a list of Docker containers.

### Mac:
1. **Install Docker Desktop:** Download and install Docker Desktop for Mac from: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
2. **Start Docker Desktop:** Launch the Docker Desktop application once the installation is complete.
3. **Open Terminal:** Open the Terminal application on your Mac.
4. **Verify Installation:** Similar to Windows, use the command docker ps -a in the Terminal to verify Docker is functioning as expected.

### Linux:
1. **Install Docker:** The installation process for Linux varies depending on your distribution. Refer to the official documentation for detailed instructions: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/
2. **Start Docker and Verify:** Follow the same steps as described for Mac to start Docker and verify its installation using the docker ps -a command in the terminal.

- **Input Data:**
  - **Download Sample Data:** Use the provided commands to download sample data for the Sipsey Fork case study.
  - **To generate your own data:** Refer to the [NGIAB-datapreprocessor](https://github.com/AlabamaWaterInstitute/NGIAB_data_preprocess) for instructions on generating custom input data.
  - **To generate your own data and run using NGIAB:** Refer to the [ngen-datastream repository](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main) for instructions on generating custom input data.

This section guides you through downloading and preparing the sample input data for the NextGen In A Box project.

### Step 1: Create Project Directory

- **Linux/Mac users:** Open your terminal and go to your desired folder where you want to checkout repo and ngen-data folder and run the following commands:
```bash
mkdir -p NextGen/ngen-data
```

```bash
cd NextGen/ngen-data
```
- **Windows users: WSL (Right click and run as Admin):** Open WSL with administrator privileges and execute:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/<Folder>
```

```bash
mkdir -p NextGen/ngen-data
```

```bash
cd NextGen/ngen-data
```
### Step 2: Download Sample Data

- **Linux/Mac/Windows WSL:** Use wget to download the compressed data file:
```bash
wget --no-parent https://ciroh-ua-ngen-data.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/AWI-006/AWI_16_2853886_006.tar.gz
```

### Step 3: Extract and Rename

- **All Platforms:** Extract the downloaded file and optionally rename the folder:
```bash
tar -xf AWI_16_2853886_006.tar.gz
```
### Rename the folder
```bash
mv AWI_16_2853886_006 my_data
```
Now you have successfully downloaded and prepared the sample input data in the NextGen/ngen-data directory.

### Step 4: Pull images (Optional)
- **For Mac**:
    ```bash
    docker pull awiciroh/ciroh-ngen-image:latest
    docker pull docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.25.x
    docker pull awiciroh/tethys-ngiab:main
    ```

- **For Windows/Linux**:
    ```bash
    docker pull awiciroh/ciroh-ngen-image:latest-x86
    docker pull docker.osgeo.org/geoserver:2.25.x
    docker pull awiciroh/tethys-ngiab:main
    ```
