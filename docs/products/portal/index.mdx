# CIROH Research Portal 🌐

🔍 The CIROH Research Portal brings together a diverse community of scientists and NOAA NWM researchers, providing an organized platform to catalog, coordinate, and share critical water research resources. Our mission is to create a centralized hub for:

- Interactive web applications 📊
- Research Datasets 📁
- Educational Courses 🎓
- Publications 📖

This initiative bridges cutting-edge NWM modeling advances with accessible demonstration tools and datasets, serving as both a research coordination tool and a showcase for NOAA-CIROH collaboration achievements.

![CIROH Portal](/img/products/portal/ciroh_portal_home.png)

The resulting serves as a pathway for advances in research tools to inform the development of future applications within the National Water Center – e.g. within the Water Prediction Operations Division (WPOD) and the Geo Intelligence Division (GID). This project is a cross-cutting activity, exposing NWM research results across disciplines and institutions. The NWM Research Apps Portal is a highly visible resource that NOAA and CIROH leadership can use to showcase the work accomplished by the collaboration and within the cooperative institute. It also serve as a communication tool to allow the broader hydrologic research community to connect with the NWM research activities.

As a cross-disciplinary resource, it enables:
- Enhanced visibility for NWM research outcomes 🌟
- Leadership demonstration of collaborative achievements 🏆
- Community engagement with hydrologic research initiatives 🤝
