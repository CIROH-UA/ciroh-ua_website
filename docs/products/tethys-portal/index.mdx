# 💧 CIROH Tethys Portal

The **CIROH Tethys Portal** is the web entry point for CIROH’s hydrology applications.  

It provides researchers, partners, and developers with a unified platform for **visualization, data access, and app hosting**.

---

## 🌍 What It Is

- Deployed in a **Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) environment** for scalability and reliability.  
- Hosts a mix of **native CIROH apps** (dashboards, data explorers) and **proxied tools** (JupyterHub, HydroShare, NWM Map Viewer).  

This architecture ensures:
- 🔒 Only the Application Load Balancer is internet-facing.  
- 🗂️ Data storage and caching (Postgres, Redis) remain secure and internal.  
- 📈 CIROH hydrologic models and data products are easily visualized in the browser.  

---

## 📚 Built-in Apps

The portal aggregates CIROH’s tools in one place:

- **Native apps**: Tethys Dash, Water Data Explorer, HydroCompute/HydroLang demo, SWEML, Ground Subsetting Tool, Snow Inspector, CSES.  
- **Proxied apps**: NWM Map Viewer, CIROH JupyterHub, HydroShare, FIM Visualization, Numerical Flash-Flood Alerts.  

---

## 🚀 Why It Matters

- **Researchers** → visualize NextGen model outputs (ngen, troute, LSTM).  
- **Developers** → deploy and test hydrology apps inside CIROH’s infrastructure.
