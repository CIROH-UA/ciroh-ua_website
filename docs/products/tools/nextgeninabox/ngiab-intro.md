- "NextGen In a Box" (NGIAB) is a containerized version of the NextGen National Water Resources Modeling Framework.
- The project's key achievement is the development and distribution of NGIAB, which makes the NextGen framework more accessible to the research community.
- NGIAB enhances research infrastructure and promotes the integration of the NextGen Framework.
- The project includes training sessions for researchers to work more efficiently with the NextGen framework.
- NGIAB is a a community version of the National Water Model (NWM). CIROH, in collaboration with Lynker, is establishing the processes, protocols, and research infrastructure that bridges the academic and research community with NOAA's National Water Center's NextGen National Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen Framework).
- It is a community version, allowing the NextGen framework to run on local machines for watersheds of any size.
