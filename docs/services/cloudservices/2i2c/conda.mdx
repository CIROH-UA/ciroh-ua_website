# Persistent Conda Environments on CIROH 2i2c Server
To ensure your Conda environments persist across server restarts on the CIROH 2i2c server, create them in your home directory. Follow these steps:

### 1. Create a directory for Conda environments:
You can set up a directory within your home folder to store all your Conda environments. This prevents them from being removed when the server is restarted. For example:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/conda_envs
```
### 2. Create a new environment in that directory:
Use the *--prefix* option with conda create to specify the location where you want to create your environment. For example, to create an environment called *my_env* in *~/conda_envs*:

```bash
conda create --prefix ~/conda_envs/my_env python=3.9
```
### 3. Activate the environment:
You can activate the environment as usual, using the path to where you created it:

```bash
conda activate ~/conda_envs/my_env
```

### 4. Automatically activate the environment on restart:
 If you want this environment to be activated every time you log in or the server restarts, you can add the following to your *.bashrc* or *.bash_profile* file:

```bash
conda activate ~/conda_envs/my_env
```

By creating your environments in your home folder (e.g., *~/conda_envs/*), they will persist across server restarts, ensuring that you don't have to recreate them every time.
