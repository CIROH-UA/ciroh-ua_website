# A Step-by-Step Guide: Requesting custom images
If you have a request for creating custom images, then please follow these instructions.
### 1. Create an environment.yml file:
- Open your terminal or command prompt. Make sure you have conda installed and activated in the environment that contains the packages you want to use for creating custom images. Learn more [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

- Run the following command, replacing **ENVNAME** with the actual name of your environment.

```bash
conda env export -n ENVNAME > environment.yml
```

### 2. Submit a Request Form:


- Click on the link below to access the Jupyterhub (2i2c) Software Install form. 
- Select Install Software on CIROH 2i2c JupyterHub as a reason for request. 
- Fill out remaining sections of the form and submit it.
