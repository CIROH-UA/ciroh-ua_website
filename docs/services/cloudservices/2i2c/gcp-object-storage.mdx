This guide is for managing objects in GCP buckets available on 2i2c CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub. For more detailed explanation, you can visit [2i2c docs site](https://docs.2i2c.org/user/topics/data/object-storage/manage-object-storage-gcp/).

### 1. Overview
CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub uses object Google Cloud Storage to store data in buckets (containers for objects). Currently, there are two buckets available to use on CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub. 
- **Scratch Bucket**: It is intended for storing temporary files since any files in scratch bucket get deleted after seven days. Open a terminal in CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub and run this command to display your scratch bucket name:

```
echo $SCRATCH_BUCKET
gs://awi-ciroh-scratch/<username>
```
**Note:** In the above command output, the name of the bucket is 'awi-ciroh-scratch' and `<username>` is the folder in the bucket.

- **Persistent Bucket**: It is recommended to use for storing files that you will be using for a longer period of time. Open a terminal in CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub and run this command to display your persistent bucket name:

```
echo $PERSISTENT_BUCKET
gs://awi-ciroh-persistent/<username>
```

### 2. Copying file to a bucket
You can copy files on your CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub to an available bucket using the following command.

```
gcloud storage cp <filepath> $PERSISTENT_BUCKET/<filepath>
```

### 3. Copying file from a bucket to CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub
You can copy files from an accessible bucket to your CIROH-2i2c JupyterHub using the following command.

```
gcloud storage cp $PERSISTENT_BUCKET/<filepath> <destination-filepath>
```

### 4. Listing files in a bucket
You can list all files/folder in a bucket using the following command.

```
gcloud storage ls $PERSISTENT_BUCKET
```
**Note:** The above command will list all files/folders in the folder `<username>`. It won't list files in the sub-folders of folder `<username>`. To list all files including the files in the sub-folders of the root folder `<username>`, use the following command.

```
gcloud storage ls --recursive $PERSISTENT_BUCKET
```

### 5. Deleting file from a bucket
You can delete a file in a bucket with the following command:

```
gcloud storage rm $PERSISTENT_BUCKET/<filepath>
```

### 6. User permssions on buckets
All users have read/write permissions on both the scratch and persistent buckets.

:::note
Anyone can access each other's files in buckets on the hub. Please be careful not to delete other user's files. Using the enviornment variables ($SCRATCH_BUCKET & $PERSISTENT_BUCKET) to access buckets in commands would prevent accidententally deleting any other user's files. Your actions impact the entire organization's storage. If unsure, consult with the team lead or ciroh IT support.

### 7. Accessing buckets in Python
You can find information on how to access buckets in Python code, [here.](https://docs.2i2c.org/user/topics/data/object-storage/working-with-object-storage/)
