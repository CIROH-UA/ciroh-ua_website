# Python Package Version Conflicts

### Overview:

When different versions of Python packages are installed in your user home directory than the version that was already installed in the JupyterHub image, these local installations take precedence, potentially causing version mismatches and unexpected behavior.

### Troubleshooting guide:

#### Step 1: Identify Package Conflicts
```bash
ls ~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/
```
**Note**: Replace X.Y with your Python version (e.g., 3.10). Find your version with `python --version`.

#### Step 2: Remove conflicting packages from user home directory

Clear all locally installed Python packages:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y
```
**Note**: This will remove **ALL** Python packages installed in your home directory and ensure that only system or environment packages are used.

#### Step 3: Verify Your Environment
- Verify that you are using the correct JupyterHub image by checking the JUPYTER_IMAGE environment variable:

```bash
echo $JUPYTER_IMAGE
```
- Reinstall needed packages properly
```bash
pip install <package-name>
```
