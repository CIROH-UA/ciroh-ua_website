# CIROH AWS Research Cloud

CIROH has teamed with AWS Cloud to deliver ground-breaking research and speed up time to insight for hydrological researchers.

The research journey is shortened by moving research burdens to the cloud, which also increases data accessibility and sharing.

Using AWS for hydrological projects allows them to manage, stage, store, share, and analyze their data in a variety of ways.


## Benefits of using AWS Cloud Services:

- Improves accessibility and analysis of research data
- Providing researchers with access to specialized solutions
- Bringing the best IT services to research project
- Reduces the duation of the research project
