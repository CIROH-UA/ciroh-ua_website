# AWS Best Practices for CIROH AWS Users

As the main account administrator for CIROH subaccount, here are some best practices to follow within your subaccount:

## Security:

- **MFA:** Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all subaccount users and admins to enhance account security.
  
- **IAM roles for resources:** Instead of individual access keys, utilize IAM roles for accessing resources within subaccounts. This simplifies access management and eliminates the need for storing long-lived credentials.
  
- **Regularly review and update permissions:** Regularly review and update user and role permissions within subaccounts to ensure they remain aligned with their current needs.

- **Utilize git-secrets**: git-secrets is a client tool that prohibits unwanted commits containing secret data such as API keys, passwords, and tokens. You can integrate it into your CI/CD pipelines to prevent sensitive information from being added to your GitHub repositories. For more information, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/scan-git-repositories-for-sensitive-information-and-security-issues-by-using-git-secrets.html) and the [git-secrets GitHub repository](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets).

- **Use AWS Secrets Manager**: Use AWS Secrets Manager, or other secrets management solution, so you donâ€™t have to hardcode keys in plaintext. The application or client can then retrieve secrets when needed. For more information, see [What is AWS Secrets Manager?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html)

## Access Key Management :

- Never store your access key in plain text, in a code repository, or in code.
- Never check in the access key in the public repository.
- Disable or delete access key when no longer needed.
- Enable least-privilege permissions.
- Rotate access keys regularly, preferably every 90 days.

## Resource Management:

- **Tagging:** Implement a consistent tagging strategy for resources in all linked accounts. This allows for better cost allocation, resource identification, and easier filtering when managing resources across multiple accounts. Follow [How to tag resources on AWS](https://docs.ciroh.org/docs/services/cloudservices/aws/tagging).

- **Cost allocation**: Allowed limit for **new** subaccount is $500/project per month. Monitor the usage throughout the month and if it reaches above $500/project, notify admin of the subaccount to take necessary actions. For projects expecting more than $500 per month usage, please email ciroh-it-admin@ua.edu in advance to get the approval from higher management. **Effective Sept 2024**, we transitioned to a new budgeting model (for existing
users) that provides your CIROH AWS subaccount with a $10,000 budget for
every 6-month period and monthly max limit of $3000. This change will give
you more flexibility to plan and execute your research workloads without the
constraints of a monthly cap.

- **Resource quotas:** Set resource quotas for subaccounts to limit their spending and resource usage. This helps prevent accidental overspending and ensures efficient resource allocation.

- **Monitor resource usage:** Encourage subaccount admins to monitor their resource usage regularly to identify potential cost optimization opportunities.

- **Data Locality:** Always consider the location of your data when selecting a region for deploying resources. Deploying resources in the same region as your data minimizes data transfer costs and latency, leading to improved performance and cost-efficiency.

- **Region Selection:** Carefully evaluate the available AWS regions and select the one that best aligns with your data residency requirements, compliance needs, and desired performance characteristics.

EBS:
- **EBS Volume Management: Avoiding Unnecessary Costs:** Terminate EBS Volumes with Terminated Instances: When terminating an EC2 instance, ensure that you also delete any associated EBS volumes that are no longer needed. EBS volumes incur charges even if they are not attached to a running instance.

- **Regularly Review EBS Volume Usage:** Periodically review your EBS volumes using the EC2 Management Console or AWS CLI. Identify any unattached volumes that are no longer required and delete them to avoid ongoing charges.

EFS:
- **Data Lifecycle Management:** Evaluate your data access patterns. For infrequently accessed files, consider migrating data from Amazon EFS to Amazon S3 to leverage its cost-efficient storage classes, such as S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier.

- **Tiered Storage Strategy:** Implement a tiered storage strategy where frequently accessed data resides on EFS for high performance, while infrequently accessed or archival data is moved to S3 for cost-effective long-term storage.

## Governance and Compliance:

- **Standardized configurations:** Establish and enforce standardized configurations for resources across linked accounts. This ensures consistency and simplifies management.
  
- **Compliance policies:** Implement compliance policies for subaccounts to ensure they adhere to relevant regulations and internal standards.
  
- **Logging and auditing:** Enable logging and auditing for all activities within linked accounts to track resource usage, identify potential security threats, and maintain compliance.
  
- **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular security audits of linked accounts to identify and address any vulnerabilities.

## Additional Recommendations:

- **Centralized documentation:** Use CIROH DocuHub ([docs.ciroh.org](https://docs.ciroh.org)) as a central location for documenting procedures, best practices, and resource usage guidelines for linked accounts.

- **Training and awareness:** Offer training and awareness programs to subaccount admins on secure practices, compliance requirements, and resource management best practices through CIROH AWS Office hours.

- **Regular communication:** Maintain regular communication with subaccount admins to address their concerns, answer questions, and share updates regarding policies and procedures via Slack Channel and also available through CIROH AWS Office hours.

## Application Deployment:

- Use terraforms or any Infrastructure as Code if possible for your application deployment.
