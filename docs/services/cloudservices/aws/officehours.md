# CIROH AWS Office Hours

Scheduled the monthly CIROH AWS Office Hour sessions, an opportunity for discussing AWS-related inquiries with direct response from AWS experts. These sessions cover various topics, AWS services, projects, and other topics of interest. AWS technical staff is available to address the community's AWS questions and have discussions around best practices. We encourage CIROH members to participate to learn more about how to effectively leverage AWS tools and resources for their projects and share knowledge and experience with fellow CIROH members.
