# Best Practices for Working with GCP Storage Buckets

This guide outlines essential practices to help you manage Google Cloud Storage buckets effectively. More information on best practices for Cloud Storage can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/best-practices).

### 1. Object Management and Security
- Use clear, consistent names for buckets and objects, avoiding sensitive information.
- Organize objects logically and use versioning for critical data if enabled.
- Use client-side encryption for sensitive data before uploading.
- To securely share content with users who don't have accounts, use signed URLs.
- Use strong authentication and avoid storing sensitive data in object metadata.

### 2. Accessing the Bucket

- Use [Application Default Credentials (ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) for authentication in your code, and never hardcode credentials.
- Implement proper error handling, logging, and unit tests in your bucket interaction code.
- Follow language-specific best practices and use type hinting (in Python) for better code readability and error prevention.
- Use environment variables or configuration files for changeable parameters like bucket names, and leverage secret management solutions for sensitive information.
- Regularly update dependencies, use HTTPS for all communications, and implement retry logic for improved security and resilience.

:::note
Your actions impact the entire organization's storage. If unsure, consult with the team lead or ciroh IT support.
