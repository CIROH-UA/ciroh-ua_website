# Best Practices for Working with GCP Storage Buckets
Given your current access permissions, this guide will help you work effectively and safely with Google Cloud Storage buckets.

#### Understanding Your Permissions
You have been granted the following permissions:
- Storage Object Creator
- Storage Object User
- Storage Object Viewer
These permissions allow you to create buckets, list existing buckets, create objects within buckets, and list/read objects.

## Best Practices
### 1.	Naming Conventions 
- Use clear, descriptive names for buckets and objects
- Avoid using sensitive information in names
- Follow a consistent naming pattern (e.g., project-environment-purpose)

### 2.	Bucket Creation 
-	Before creating a new bucket, check if an appropriate one already exists
-	Document the purpose of each bucket you create
-	Set appropriate region/location based on data residency requirements
### 3.	Object Management 
-	Organize objects using a logical folder structure
-	Use object versioning for critical data
-	Set appropriate object lifecycle rules to manage storage costs
### 4.	Data Protection 
-	Enable object versioning for important data
-	Set up retention policies for regulatory compliance if needed
-	Use client-side encryption for sensitive data before uploading
### 5.	Cost Management 
-	Monitor storage usage regularly
-	Set up budget alerts to avoid unexpected costs
-	Use appropriate storage classes based on access patterns
### 6.	Performance 
-	Choose the appropriate location for your buckets to minimize latency
-	Use composite objects for large files (>5GB)
-	Implement retry logic in your applications for better resilience
### 7.	Logging and Monitoring 
-	Enable Cloud Audit Logs for bucket and object-level activities
-	Set up monitoring and alerting for unusual activities or errors
### 8.	Cleanup and Maintenance 
-	Regularly review and remove unnecessary objects and buckets
-	Archive or delete old versions of objects if versioning is enabled
### 9.	Security 
-	Use signed URLs for temporary access to objects
-	Implement strong authentication mechanisms in your applications
-	Avoid storing sensitive data in object metadata
### 10.	 Accessing Buckets in Code 
-	Use Application Default Credentials (ADC) for authentication in your code
-	Follow these steps to set up ADC: a. Ensure you're logged into your Google account in the browser b. Install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine c. 
-	Run gcloud auth application-default login in the terminal d. This authenticates you and stores the credentials locally
-	In your Python code, use the following to access buckets:
``` python
from google.auth import default
from google.cloud import storage
credentials, project = default()
fs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem(token=credentials)
```
### 11.	Code Development Best Practices
-	 Use version control (e.g., Git) for all your code 
-	Implement proper error handling and logging in your scripts 
-	Follow Python (or your chosen language) best practices and style guides 
-	Use environment variables or configuration files for bucket names and other changeable parameters 
-	Implement unit tests for your bucket interaction code 
-	Use type hinting in Python for better code readability and catch potential errors early
### 12.	Security in Code 
-	Never hardcode credentials in your scripts
-	Use secret management solutions for storing sensitive information
-	Implement proper exception handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
-	Regularly update your dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
-	Use HTTPS for all network communications


Remember: Your actions can affect the entire organization's storage infrastructure. When in doubt, consult with your team lead or GCP administrator.
