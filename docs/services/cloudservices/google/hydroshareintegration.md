## CIROH Jupyterhub Integrated with HydroShare

Users now have the capability to directly launch and execute notebooks from HydroShare within the CIROH Jupyterhub environments. Wondering how to do it? Here are the steps for you to follow:

1. First, confirm that you have access to the CIROH Jupyterhub.
2. Head to HydroShare and navigate to the "CIROH Production Jupyterhub" at this [URL](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/2dd1ac86e8854d4fb9fe5fbafaec2b98/)
3. Ensure that the square icon labeled "CIROH Staging JupyterHub" in HydroShare is green. If it appears red, a single click will change it to green.
