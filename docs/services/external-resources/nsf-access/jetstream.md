JetStream2 is accessible to the CIROH members and partners of the Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH).

Jetstream2 is a powerful hybrid-cloud platform designed for researchers and educators. It offers a range of flexible, on-demand, and programmable infrastructure tools, from interactive virtual machines (VMs) to advanced infrastructure and orchestration services. The primary resource consists of AMD Milan 7713 CPUs with 128 cores per node and 512 GB RAM per node, all connected by a high-speed 100 gbps wthernet.

### Use cases:

Jetstream2 is ideal for researchers with diverse needs:

- **On-demand virtual machines**: It is ideal for research that requires on demand virtual machine services. It is also best for researchers needing to create their own customized virtual machine environment for specific software needs.
- **Always-on research infrastructure**: It can host research-supporting infrastructure services that require continuous operation.
- **Educational support**: It can be used to provide virtual machines for student use in research or coursework.
