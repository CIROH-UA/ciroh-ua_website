# CIROH-UA 2i2c JupyterHub (GCP)

CIROH-UA has teamed with 2i2c Cloud service to design, develop and operate JupyterHub in the google cloud for hydrologic researchers. It builds and supports open source infrastructure that serves research and development.

## Benefits of using 2i2c Cloud Services:

- Provides managed JupyterHub as a service
- Powerful, flexible, and dynamic. Open source tools are the best for accelerating research.
- 2i2c uses Google Cloud services for JupyterHub deployment.
