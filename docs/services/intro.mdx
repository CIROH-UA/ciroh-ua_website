# CIROH CyberInfrastructure: Unleashing Potential in Hydrological Research
## Computing infrastructure access for consortium members and partners 

			
The <strong>CIROH CyberInfrastructure</strong> empowers CIROH consortium members by providing a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly computing platform. We understand the challenges researchers face in managing <strong>computational resources</strong>, and the CIROH CyberInfrastructure alleviates these burdens by offering a suite of pre-configured environments and resources. Our team of engineers and developers meticulously optimizes both <strong>cloud-based</strong> (AWS and Google Cloud) and <strong>on-premise infrastructure</strong> (Pantarhei HPC cluster) to ensure unparalleled flexibility and scalability.

This translates into a powerful platform that includes:

*   **Simplified Access:** The CIROH CyberInfrastructure streamlines access to computational environments, eliminating the need for time-consuming installations and maintenance.
    
*   **Unmatched Flexibility:** Our multi-cloud and on-premise infrastructure provides a diverse range of options to suit your specific research needs.
    
*   **Scalable Resources:** The CIROH CyberInfrastrucure readily scales to accommodate your growing data analysis and computational demands.
    
*   **Pre-Installed Software:** Leverage pre-installed hydrological software packages to jumpstart your research endeavors.
    
*   **Streamlined Development:** Benefit from the secure and rapid application development and deployment capabilities offered by Cloud.
    

The CIROH CyberInfrastructure is meticulously designed to empower CIROH researchers and innovators to achieve groundbreaking results in hydrology. <strong>Join us and unlock the full potential of your research today!</strong>

## Definition and Scope of CyberInfrastructure

The CIROH CyberInfrastructure supports a broad ecosystem of research, development, and integration activities. Its primary scopes are to:

1. Support community development, system integration, and research cyberinfrastructure for a large consortium of members and partners.  
2. Assist in integrating research products from consortium members into a unified presentation for sponsors to evaluate for potential operational applications.  
3. Conduct independent research, particularly in data science, machine learning, computational and algorithmic optimization, and visualization.

## CIROH CyberInfrastructure Goals

* Promote **reproducible hydrologic computing experiments** with the NextGen Water Resource Modeling Framework.  
* Provide support for, and reduce the barrier to entry for performing **NextGen-related experiments** at various scales.  
* Accelerate the **interconnection and integration of research products and hydroinformatics innovations** from the various ongoing CIROH experiments.  
* Provide a **flexible, scalable, and secure infrastructure** for researchers to perform computational tasks, store, and analyze data.  
* Enable researchers to **run simulations, analyze large datasets, and collaborate** across different locations through cloud and on-premise systems.  
* Advance hydrological modeling through **DevOps practices**, **Cloud–HPC integration**, and **open-source development** of NextGen and related tools.  
* Enhance **research impact and community engagement** for CIROH projects, while addressing computational challenges and facilitating experiments across scales.  
* Strengthen cyberinfrastructure to support **R2O2R** (Research to Operations to Research) activities in hydrology.
