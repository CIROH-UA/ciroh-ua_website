## New content
- The "Community Hydrologic Modeling" tab has been completely reworked! It's now called "NextGen In A Box", better reflecting the content of the folder. ([#427](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ciroh-ua_website/pull/427))
    - Lots of new content has been added alongside this change within the "Intro to NGIAB" sub-section.
    - NGIAB product subpages have been reorganized into the "Distributions" and "Components" sub-sections.
    - As a part of this transition, content regarding the Reseach Datastream (formerly "NextGen Datastream") has been spun out into its own category.
- The "Research Datastream" tab now correctly includes its documentation subpages from GitHub. ([#425](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ciroh-ua_website/pull/425))
