REGARDING BLOG AUTHOR PHOTOS

In order to ensure that author photos remain accurate and up to date, our standard policy is to embed their profile photos from Slack or other permanent sources.
However, in some cases, no such source exists with an appropriate aspect ratio. In these cases, we host an appropriately-cropped photo here.

If you are the author of a DocuHub blog and would like your profile image changed, please reach out to us, and we'll swap it out as soon as possible.
